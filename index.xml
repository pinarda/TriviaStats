source(&amp;quot;trivia_stats.R&amp;quot;) Bias Heatmap Each column represents the scores on one person’s round that week. Higher scores in a cell mean that the player tends to gain more points than other players on that creator’s rounds.

      <description> Ideas Get rounds labeled and do stuff (bias table/plot for round types maybe)
do score prediction based on difficulty, player average, and round label/maybe biases
 To Do Finish player plots
Format output so we don’t have to scroll through dozens of charts to find the right one
Whose nights get Jokered most, how often was it the correct choice to joker their rounds
