<h1>roboAlex 1.0</h1>
<p>roboAlex 1.0 is simple. He knows three things: how well human Alex does on a typical trivia round, whether or not human Alex jokered the current round (this one is cheating a bit), and how well everyone else did on the current round. I wish I only had to know three things.</p>
<p>Below I’ll go into more detail about how each of these factors contribute to the overall score. But first, we will check some assumptions we made about the data.</p>
<p>This is a list of all the round scores on every round. The output here shows scores on Zach’s first six rounds. This list is all the data we need to make roboAlex work.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(allScores)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   Zach Megan Ichigo Jenny Mom  Dad Chris Alex Jeff Drew
## 2   NA     3   2.00   2.0 3.0  2.0    NA  2.0   NA   NA
## 3   NA     9   9.00  10.0 3.0 10.0    NA  8.0   NA   NA

## 6   NA     5   2.25   4.5 1.5  6.0  3.75  3.5   NA   NA
## 7   NA     5   5.00   4.0 4.0  8.0  6.00  7.0   NA   NA</code></pre>
<div id="check-for-normality" class="section level2">
<h2>Check for normality</h2>
<p>roboAlex makes a critical assumption that players’ scores on a between rounds are independent and normally distributed. We are going to assume that the round scores are independent for now, and that anyone over- or under-performing on a night is purely due to getting a good or bad set of questions for them. It seems reasonable.</p>
<p>The histogram below shows the distribution of human Alex’s scores on each round, with a normal distribution overlaid. A really really simple roboAlex might just use this normal distribution and no other information, but his scores on most rounds would not convince you that this was the “real” Alex.</p>
<p>Here are some technical details (they aren’t that important, just look at the histogram). The Q-Q plot compares the data we have to a normal distribution. If our data is truly normally distributed, then our data would fall very close to the diagonal line. It looks like the ends of the distribution don’t match up to what we would expect from a normal exactly, but it is close enough to be a reasonable approximation. The output from the k-s test, specifically the p-value, indicates whether there is reasonable belief that the data is not drawn from a specified distribution. The usual cutoff for the p-value is 0.05, and since our p-value is well below that, we conclude that the data is probably not exactly normal. Something I need to do is normalize the round scores because right now some rounds are out of 8 and some out of 10 (or more), this might fix the non-normality we are seeing in the histogram.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>suppressWarnings(ggplot(allScores, aes(x = Alex)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth=1, na.rm=TRUE) + ylab(&quot;Probability&quot;)+xlab(&quot;Alex&#39;s Scores&quot;)+
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = mean(allScores$Alex, na.rm=TRUE),
                                         sd = sd(allScores$Alex, na.rm=TRUE))))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/TriviaStats/2021-5-17-roboAlex_1.0_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>randomUnif &lt;- runif(length(na.omit(allScores$Alex)), -0.5, 0.5)
qqData &lt;- na.omit(allScores$Alex) + randomUnif
qqnorm(qqData, )
qqline(qqData)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/TriviaStats/2021-5-17-roboAlex_1.0_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-2.png" width="672" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>suppressWarnings(ks.test(na.omit(allScores$Alex), &quot;pnorm&quot;,
        mean(allScores$Alex, na.rm=TRUE),
        sd(allScores$Alex, na.rm=TRUE)))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
##  One-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
## 
## data:  na.omit(allScores$Alex)
## D = 0.11549, p-value = 0.0002069
## alternative hypothesis: two-sided</code></pre>
<p>So maybe the tails are a bit light for a normal distribution. Whatever. I doubt anyone will notice the difference during trivia night.</p>
</div>
<div id="thing-1-human-alexs-average-round-score" class="section level2">
<h2>Thing 1: Human Alex’s average round score</h2>
<p>Now we’ll look at how roboAlex uses each piece of information it has available. The first things measures how good human Alex is at Hail Science trivia in general.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(ggplot2)
meanAlex &lt;- mean(allScores$Alex, na.rm=TRUE)
meanAlex</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 5.942326</code></pre>
<p>This quantity represents the base score that roboAlex predicts human Alex will score on a given round, without any additional information.</p>
</div>
<div id="thing-2-did-human-alex-joker-this-round" class="section level2">
<h2>Thing 2: Did human Alex joker this round?</h2>
<p>Human Alex picks rounds based on the theme and creator of each round. roboAlex does not know about these things. Naive little roboAlex trusts that human Alex knows what he is doing. roboAlex assigns Alex’s mean score on Joker rounds as the base score for his joker round. I change the base score this way because when I compared roboAlex’s predicted score on Joker rounds to real Alex’s actual scores, they tended to be lower. Knowledge of the creator and theme appear to have a predictive effect on round score that cannot be fully inferred by just looking at everyone else’s scores. This is good news for roboAlex 2.0, which will look at these quantities when making predictions.</p>
<p>However, there is a flaw. Based on everyone’s scores on the round, you can make an informed guess about the creator of the round or the theme, and vice versa. By using human Alex’s mean joker score as the base score for the round and also taking into account everyone else’s scores, we are double-counting the information about creator and theme. Since this information usually benefits Alex on joker rounds, this gives roboAlex a bit of an extra advantage on Joker rounds compared to human Alex. Luckily, we will see in the next section that roboAlex 1.0 also tends to slightly underperform on non-joker rounds. These flaws come close to evening out in the overall expected score for the night.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>get_average_joker_round(&quot;Alex&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 7.252909</code></pre>
<p>The above score represents the base score that roboAlex predicts Alex will score on a joker round, without any additional information.</p>
</div>
<div id="thing-3-how-well-did-everyone-else-do-on-this-round" class="section level2">
<h2>Thing 3: How well did everyone else do on this round?</h2>
<p>Knowing how well everyone else did on a round makes roboAlex more realistic in two ways. First, if a round is difficult, players tend to score lower on a round, and roboAlex can adjust his score down accordingly. Second, as we saw in the player similarity table, some players’ scores tend to be more predictive of Alex’s score than others. For example, we would hope to see roboAlex doing better on rounds where Dad and Ichigo also performed well (this might mean it is a round about something that real Alex is good at, like games). Likewise, if Mom does really well, it is more likely be a round that human Alex is not good at (like plants… or maybe a Dad-created round, which are surprisingly bad for human Alex).</p>
<p>We represent the relationships between players, called the joint variability, in a covariance matrix. It’s somewhat like the player similarity matrix, but it has each player’s score variance on the diagonals, and it happens to be positive everywhere (All players scores tend to move in tandem due to the changes in round difficulty, even if they are not similar players. Round difficulty has a larger effect than player-player relationships, so combining those two effects results in a positive matrix.)</p>

<h2>Putting it all together - Prediction</h2>
<p>The mean values and covariances are the only variables we need to simulate what is called a conditional multivariate normal distribution. All we need now are the proper equations.</p>
<p>It is important to note that just because each of our player’s scores follows an (approximate) normal distributions does NOT mean that the joint distribution will follow a multivariate normal. But I’m going to assume that without evidence here, because I’ll get to the proof later (maybe…). We’ll see that the approximation is pretty accurate later on, so I am not too worried about the assumption in this fairly simple situation.</p>
<p>Penn State has a good <a href="https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat505/lesson/6/6.1">explanation</a> of the math behind the conditional multivariate normal, but the following equation is what we need:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(E(Y|X=x) = \mu_Y + \Sigma_{YX} \Sigma_{X}^{-1} (x - \mu_X)\)</span></p>
<p>Breaking down this equation:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(E(Y|X=x)\)</span> is our prediction, how well we think roboAlex is going to score given that everyone else has scored <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> (a vector).</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\mu_Y\)</span> is how well human Alex scores on an average round, this is the overall mean (Thing 1) (or Thing 2, if this is a joker round). To this term we add an adjustment based on how everyone else did, which is comprised of the next three terms.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\Sigma_{YX}\)</span> is a vector representing one row of the covariance matrix (Thing 3). In particular, it is the row corresponding to the player Alex, without the entry located at (Alex, Alex). This entries of this vector give us a idea of much Alex’s score would be adjusted up or down if we were given a single other player’s performance.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\Sigma_{X}^{-1}\)</span> is where most of the magic happens. This matrix can be found by taking the covariance matrix (Thing 3), removing the Alex row and column, and inverting it. This is called a <a href="https://stephens999.github.io/fiveMinuteStats/normal_markov_chain.html">precision matrix</a>. This matrix allows us to quantify how much independent information we receive from each player’s score to properly adjust our estimate.</p>
<p>In the Thing 2 section I mentioned that we have a problem where we are double counting some of the factors that contribute to the overall score. We run the risk of doing the same thing here. For example: If we know that both Zach and Jenny did exceptionally well on a given round, we can make a pretty good guess that Megan also did well on that round. Actually being told that Megan also did well does not give us as much additional information as it would if we did not know Zach and Jenny’s scores, because those scores are not independent of each other. If we don’t take this into account and instead revise our estimate of Alex’s score upward by the full amount each time we see that someone did well on this round, will we end up accounting for the low difficulty of this round several times and our predicted score will be much too high. <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma_{X}^{-1}\)</span> solves this problem for us.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\((x - \mu_X)\)</span> is a vector representing everyone else’s performance on this round relative to their average score. When multiply it by the quantity <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma_{YX}\Sigma_{X}^{-1}\)</span>, each term in the resulting summation tells us how much the individual player performances affected the overall round estimate for Alex.</p>
<p>I said before that this will underestimate Alex’s performance on each round. Why? Because whenever we are playing a round, the creator for that round does not receive a score (at least not one worth using to predict with). So when we are playing Ichigo’s round, her contribution to Alex’s predicted score, which would normally be positive, is zero. To account for this we could recompute the covariance matrix and leave out one player each time, and use the appropriate table when we are on a particular player’s round. This might do a better job of taking into account round creator, but it takes a lot of space on the google sheet and adds a bit of complexity I haven’t had time to deal with yet. We could also try using the bias table estimates and adding in the bonus from the round creator, though that also risks double-counting the creator’s effect on the predicted score since the other player’s scores are implicitly taking that into account already.</p>

<h2>Putting it all together - Simulation</h2>
<p>Our best estimate of how well real Alex will perform on this round is given by <span class="math inline">\(E(Y|X=x)\)</span>, if we want to get as close as possible to real Alex’s score, we can stop here. However, if roboAlex always predicts real Alex’s score, it won’t behave like a real trivia player. It won’t ever have an exceptionally good or bad night, and is unlikely to ever be a real threat to win. What we want to do is make roboAlex’s scores as variable as real Alex’s. We can do this with the following conditional multivariate normal equation:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(Var(Y|X=x) = \Sigma_Y - \Sigma_{YX} \Sigma_{X}^{-1} \Sigma_{XY}\)</span></p>
<p>Some of these terms we have seen, but we will break down the rest and interpret the equation:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(Var(Y|X=x)\)</span> is how much variance Alex’s scores should have after taking into account everyone else’s scores <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. Notice that <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> does not appear in the right-hand side of the equation. This means that knowing everyone else’s scores reduces the variability, but it does not actually matter what those scores are, the variability will always be reduced by the same amount.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\Sigma_Y\)</span> is how much human Alex’s scores naturally vary. A 9 on this round, a 4 on that. It happens.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\Sigma_{XY}\)</span> is the transposed version of <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma_{YX}\)</span>. Basically, we took the vector and stood it up on its end. This is needed to make the matrix multiplication work out.</p>
<p>In English, we are taking real Alex’s natural score variability and removing some of it. We can do this because we are more sure about the range of possible scores given the information we have from other players and how Alex’s scores usually line up with theirs. This means all histograms made from predicting a round score should have approximately the same shape, but will be shifted up or down based on the predicted score <span class="math inline">\(E(Y|X=x)\)</span>.</p>
<p>All that’s left is to pick random draws from the distribution. To start, let’s not tell roboAlex anything about how well other players did and see how it lines up with human Alex’s score distribution.</p>

<p>Not bad! Now let’s tell roboAlex that everyone did exactly as well as average and see how this changes the estimate.</p>

Seems reasonable, if everyone got a middling score we are a lot more confident that human Alex would have as well. What about one of those rounds about animated TV that Jenny, Zach and Megan always do pretty well on but no one else does? I just made all these scores up, so I can’t compare them to my actual scores on those rounds. Maybe I’ll do that at some point though.</p>

<p>Yep… What about an easy round where everyone does well? Again, maybe I’ll find rounds with high averages and compare my distributions at some point. For now we are just seeing how the estimates change compared to my historical scores when we add information about everyone else’s scores.</p>

Dad scoring a 10 and Ichigo getting a 9 both help a lot, roboAlex has close to an even chance of either score. Note that I truncated all predicted values above 10, assuming this round does not have bonus questions. The behavior seems plausible! With a few tweaks it might be hard to tell human Alex and roboAlex apart…</p>
<p>That’s all for now!</p>
<p>Coming in version 1.1/1.2:</p>
<p>Fix the overestimation on joker rounds, get historical data about joker score distribution and compare to the estimate given everyone else’s score on those rounds, use the difference as an adjustment.</p>
<p>Fix the underestimation generally, implicitly take creator into account by creating new covariance matrices for each creator (if we have enough data to make it reliable)</p>
<p>Get historical data on everyone scores for scenarios (easy rounds, certain themes, etc), so we can see how well roboAlex’s estimates line up with human Alex’s. Do the same for the overall night scores to see if roboAlex is well calibrated.</p>
<p>Try using htmlwidgets to make an interactive roboAlex predictor using a sample set of scores.</p>
<p>Try normalizing the round scores - the non-normality might be caused because 8 was the highest possible score for many rounds.</p>
<p>This might be later - but we might be able to adjust for round theme once we have data by creating covariances for the round theme and creator/player performance, then add those variables in to the model seperately (and eliminate the separate joker round score).</p>
