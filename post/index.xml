      <description>Ideas Plot all mean scores (as line plots) on same plot - hover to highlight a single plot (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52532428/highlight-all-values-from-a-group-on-hover) we might not be able to do this with a static site, look into it
Get round labeled and do stuff (bias table/plot for round types maybe)
do score prediction based on difficulty, player average, and round label/maybe biases
 To Do Finish player plots
Format output so we don’t have to scroll through dozens of charts to find the right one</description>

source(&amp;quot;trivia_stats.R&amp;quot;) Bias Heatmap Each column represents the scores on one person’s round that week. Higher scores in a cell mean that the player scores higher than the average on that player’s rounds.
Score Per Round = Average Player Ability + Round Difficulty + Bias + Randomness
